### Hello Gamers!

As you may have heard, we're gearing up for WarpCon and every year we have RPGs going on during the weekend! If you wanna write an RPG one shot to be run at the convention, the link is [here](https://forms.gle/7eJPtQwGJpopgaQa6) If you do write one you can get in for free and there's no deadline as of right now so take your time if you want!
