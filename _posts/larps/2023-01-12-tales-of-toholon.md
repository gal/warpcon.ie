Less than a year ago, the Tokugawan Patriots were storming government buildings and executing capitalist samurai, certain their morals and liberated superweapons would bring victory and a glorious future to their nation. Today, their last few commanders are gathered in an isolated castle on an island far from their homeland. They've lost their Shogun, their allies, and all their legitimacy. while the Bureaucrats grow ever stronger. These brave, broken few must decide the fate of their loyal soldiers: Surrender, Glorious Death, or Transformation and Rebirth.
