Not many rulers have made it to 60 years on the throne, even fewer without the aid of magic. Florian II has invited all of Lynara to the great city of Ormm in celebration of his 60th year as King. The streets will be flooded with people from all over the region, and even beyond, bringing stories and sharing their culture in what promises to be the biggest festival of the age!

With the King’s fading health, however, his public appearances are very few, and audiences with him extremely exclusive. Unfortunately, the lack of an heir has added undertones of unease among the court and government. Hopefully those tensions don’t impact the party.
