Legends tell of powerful mages who roamed the world thousands of years ago, liberating, subjugating and laying waste. Whatever they wanted, they could do. Whatever they desired, they could have. But then everything changed. No-one knows why, but magic doesn’t work any more. Maybe it never did. But then some travellers arrived… you overhear their strange language, and then they ask you for directions to a “cursed valley”, in your own language. Apparently they were using magic. When they leave, you look at your friends, and you wonder… what would you all do if you had magic?

A game for 5 delinquent teens who have just discovered magic is real.
