An ancient king’s barrow stands just outside the village where you grew up. Someone has disturbed this ancient burial mound, and brought the world of the dead uncomfortably close to the living. With the adults of the village afraid to go near the barrow, it falls to you and your friends, young and untested, to drive away this long-buried danger.

Beyond the Wall is a system designed for one-shots, where the players choose from archetypes such as the Young Woodsman, Witch’s Prentice, or Reformed Bully, and take these characters through their first real encounter with the dangers of the world. The players and GM work together to design the characters’ home village, as the GM fills out the scenario that these young adventurers-to-be will face.
For 3-5 Players of Any Experience
