Police in El Paso, Texas are currently holding a Bureau asset on suspicion of terrorist conspiracy. It is crucial that we retrieve this individual before the existence of the Bureau is revealed or the local PD have a chance to talk to the press about them. They have vital information on the activity of Jewel Priests infiltrating the USA and we have reason to suspect they've been compromised during their time in deep cover.

Your instructions are to retrieve the asset, determine what they know, and if necessary liquidate them. You are cleared for lethal measures against potentially compromised persons and blackbag protocols for anyone who knows too much are in effect.

Do not allow the operational security of this agency to be compromised.
