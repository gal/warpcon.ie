“Right lads, the Emperor's off world to deal with that first rebellion, and all this news of Bread Riots is making me peckish; party at my place while we wait out the crowds? I've got a pick up to follow up so we'll be off planet by the time those other rebels arrive! I mean; the economy's gone to hell after the currency's all been forged and rioters keep besieging villas but we've got enough food to feast on, drugs to binge on, entertainers hired (of all sorts), a menagerie to hunt and walls to hide behind until my buddy Ace comes with his ship; it'll be a grand old time! 

So c'mon, One Last Bash before the Capital becomes a Party Pooper Planet.

Ps: BYOB.”
