It's the 1920s, and in the aftermath of the great war the Technocracy (a brutal and oppressive organisation of super-scientists) has begun consolidating global power. Only the Mystic Traditions truly stand against them to keep magic in the world, a battle they've been losing since the Renaissance. 

Rumor has it that a respected and powerful Technocratic Archmaster will be making an appearance at peace-talks with the Vampires of Chicago, a rare foray into striking distance of the mystic death cultists known as the Aided. It's up to these 5 magical Irish assassins to end his life in a daring operation. Isaac Newton Must Die.
