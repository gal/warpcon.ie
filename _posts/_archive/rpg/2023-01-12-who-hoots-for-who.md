Owlbears attacking outlying villages? Pillaging them for food? They have rarely attacked before, and never in such numbers. We cannot allow them to disturb the Autumn Harvest festival. Fortunately a group of brave adventurers have stepped forward to get to the bottom of this hooting menace and put a stop to it, before every picnic basket in the land has been plundered. 

Will you be among them?
