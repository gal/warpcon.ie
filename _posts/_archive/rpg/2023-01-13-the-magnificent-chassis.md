The players are each members of the Pan-Galactic first responder force Albatross. Theyâ€™ve been called by the people of a backwater village on the planet Cantare to intervene in an attack. The bandit Santana has formed an uneasy alliance with the mercenary Elise in the hopes of taking the villager's middling wealth. Santana has no motivation to do this beyond greed. 

This one shot is a more laid back experience, and players should complete this in an hour or two at most.
