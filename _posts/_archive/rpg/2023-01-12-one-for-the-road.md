Being a dead person is not so bad. It is in fact somewhat liberating. Ryse Corp thought it would be a good idea to release their nerve damage cure without testing properly and now 40,000 people are going to flatline in the most painful of ways. You are all one of them. But you are different - you are all Edge Runners. You all have special skills that can help in some way. Ryse Corp is hiding the truth, and if it kills you getting itâ€¦ well, better to burn out than fade away!
