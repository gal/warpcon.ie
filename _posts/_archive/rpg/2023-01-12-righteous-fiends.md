For ten generations your people have fought and died to protect your god, who lies sleeping beneath the high temple, dreaming of the rebirth of the world. You are the latest in a lineage of warrior-priests; gifted with living armour, biomagical grafts, and intense training to fulfill Her commands. 

And now you are entrusted with your first holy task â€“ the great Enemy has reclaimed a ruined fort on the very edge of your land; you must find out what they want and keep it from them.
